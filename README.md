video-based-traffic-flow-detector

A traffic flow detector based on video

This software is determined to overcome the difficulties on detecting traffic flow at night without stable lighting. Current version is based on MFC as its GUI interface. What I'm planing to do is to rewrite the algorithm part with OpenCV and the GUI part with QT or sth else.
